# who_needs_a_document_management
_a list of bash scripts to stop wasting my life time with manual document management_

Why?
---------

 - You are searching for an efficient way to manage the wave of documents flooding Your mailbox and email inbox?
 - You don't want to strip all Your privacy and handover these documents to companies who provide payed document management services?
 - You are sick of wasting time searching for a bill, contract or document Your postbox was annoyed with in 2009?

That's why I am here.

I am a developer who wants to solve exactly this problem for my own case.

How?
---------

I believe in private cloud services (like [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/)). Creating a virtual webspace, registering a cheap private domain and starting [the cloud software docker container](https://hub.docker.com/_/nextcloud) has never been easier.

What private cloud software (currently) still misses, are all these document management functionalities:

 - optimize a documents photo and make it being used like a "scan"   
=> taking a photo should be effort enough
 - read the photos content (OCR) to make the document searchable  
=> file tagging, meaningful file names and folder structure
 - archive these documents in a way that's easy to handle  
=> replace closed document management systems with nothing but a clear and searchable file and folder structure
 - make all this shit run automatically to stop wasting my lifetime

How far is this project?
